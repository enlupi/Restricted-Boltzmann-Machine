# Restricted Boltzmann Machine

Midterm project for *Laboratory of Computational Physics (Mod. B)* course, Physics of Data degree at University of Padova.

## Abstract

Training a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) can prove to be a rather complex task, as there are many parameters to fine tune and choices to make in order to obtain the desired results.
In this work we will first focus on the effects of employing different types of data encodings and optimizators on the speed and effectiveness of the training, as well as the effects of increasing the number of constrastive divergence steps. Finally, we use the best hyperparametrs to train a RBM and discuss how the pattern in the weights correlates to the structure of the input data.
